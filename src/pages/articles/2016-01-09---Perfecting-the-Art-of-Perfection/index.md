Thoughts for the day: 13-December-2019 

Company determines qualities and dictate how far you'll go:

To those who lift up from animalistic human beahaviour towards higher consciousness. Using their humane-ness and living on this immense possibility called living life as a human. This is my ode, my gurudakshina, my all. Because you have shown me the path forward. 

From that day in november 2014, wherein a breakthrough was planned for me, to this day in 2019. You've shown me how gifted I am to be born as a human. How gifted I am to be born in possibilites wherein things have looked upwards in life and how great the future remains. I am so lucky on being chosen for this path, for an awakening, such early in life. No words can express it. 

To the teachers and the medium and to this path. I am humbled by your generosity. I will be walking this path with utmost joy and passion. Keep taking me with you.
